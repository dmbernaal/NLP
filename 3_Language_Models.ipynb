This ensures consistency when updating the hidden state through the whole sentence/articles.\n",

    "* the third one, is the weight dropout. It's the trickiest to implement as we randomly replace by 0s some weights of the hidden-to-hidden matrix inside the RNN: this needs to be done is a way that ensures the gradients are still computed and the initial weights still updated. This is the ```weight_p``` parameter.\n",
    "* the fourth one, is the hidden dropout. It's applied to the output of one of the layers of the RNN before it's used as input of the next layer (again same coordinates are zeroed in the sequence dimension). It isn't applied to the last output (which will get its own dropout in the decoder). This is the ```hidden_p``` parameter.\n",

       "xxbos xxmaj once again xxmaj mr. xxmaj costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary . xxmaj aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences , of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters . xxmaj most of us have ghosts in the closet , and xxmaj costner 's character are realized early on , and then forgotten until much later , by which time i did not care . xxmaj the character we should really care about is a very cocky , overconfident xxmaj ashton xxmaj kutcher . xxmaj the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he 's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet . xxmaj his only obstacle appears to be winning over xxmaj costner . xxmaj finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker , xxmaj costner tells us all about xxmaj kutcher 's ghosts . xxmaj we are told why xxmaj kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing . xxmaj no magic here , it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in .,xxbos xxmaj this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same . xxmaj generic and boring , there 's really nothing worth watching here . a complete waste of the then barely - tapped talents of xxmaj ice - t and xxmaj ice xxmaj cube , who 've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting , and acting well . xxmaj do n't bother with this one , go see xxmaj new xxmaj jack xxmaj city , xxmaj ricochet or watch xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj undercover for xxmaj ice - t , or xxmaj boyz n the xxmaj hood , xxmaj higher xxmaj learning or xxmaj friday for xxmaj ice xxmaj cube and see the real deal . xxmaj ice - t 's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth , and i 'm still wondering what the heck xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton was doing in this film ? xxmaj and why the heck does he always play the exact same character ? xxmaj from xxmaj aliens onward , every film i 've seen with xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character , and at least in xxmaj aliens his character died , which made it somewhat gratifying ... \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj overall , this is second - rate action trash . xxmaj there are countless better films to see , and if you really want to see this one , watch xxmaj judgement xxmaj night , which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script . xxmaj the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing , which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite . 4 / 10 .,xxbos xxmaj first of all i hate those moronic rappers , who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads . xxmaj all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like xxunk version of gangsters . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the movie does n't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we 're already at the warehouse xxmaj there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie , except for the homeless guy , who is also the only one with half a brain . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton and xxmaj william xxmaj sadler are both hill billies and xxmaj xxunk character is just as much a villain as the gangsters . i did'nt like him right from the start . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the movie is filled with pointless violence and xxmaj walter xxmaj hills specialty : people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere . xxmaj there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no - one . xxmaj everybody dies , except from xxmaj paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve . \n",
